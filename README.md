# TSR
TSR(Traffic Sign Recognition) using TensorFlow to adopting deep neural network

This project's final goal is real time ADAS system including
* TSR - Traffic Sign Recognition
* LD/LDWS - Lane Detection and Lane Departure Warning System
* VD - Vehicle Detection

## Software
Software will be build with Python 2.7 and C/C++. Using CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) architecture via TensorFlow.

## Hardware
To implement my system in real-time in embedded system(I'm aiming at Xilinx Zynq-7000, ZC706 SoC), hardware accelerator are necessary to run DL in real-time
