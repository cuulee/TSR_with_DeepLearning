# Python Directory
Python is used for verifying my algorithm, and estimate accuracy. Using TensorFlow for algorithm, and [GTSRB(German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news) as a training/test dataset.

* TSRwithInception.py is for top architecture
* ReadTrainData.py is reading GTSRB data from your hard-drive and load it on to your DDR main memory
* Inception_ResNet.py is implemented [Google's inception-resnet-v2](arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261) model architecture by me.

Project were begun on July 1st. So many codes are not final version and may include some/many bugs
